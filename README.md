# Deep Learning-Based Bacterial Colony Classification System

## Overview

Bacterial colony classification is a critical task in microbiology laboratories, facilitating the identification and differentiation of various bacterial species. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual observation and biochemical tests, which can be time-consuming and subjective. In recent years, the emergence of deep learning techniques has offered promising avenues for automating and improving this process.

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based bacterial colony classification system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, the aim is to differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli colonies based on images captured from agar plates.

The proposed system leverages the power of PyTorch, a widely used deep learning framework, to construct a CNN architecture capable of learning discriminative features from bacterial colony images. By training the model on a dataset containing labeled images of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli colonies, we intend to create a robust classifier capable of accurately identifying these bacterial species.

This project holds significant potential for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of bacterial colony classification in microbiology laboratories. By automating this process, we can reduce reliance on manual labor, minimize human error, and accelerate the pace of bacterial identification, ultimately contributing to advancements in healthcare, food safety, and environmental monitoring.
